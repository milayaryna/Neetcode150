# Find Median from Data Stream

'''
The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
Implement the MedianFinder class:

MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

        if self.large and num > self.large[0]:

        # Balance the heaps by adjusting their sizes if necessary
        if len(self.small) > len(self.large) + 1:
            val = -1 * heapq.heappop(self.small)
            heapq.heappush(self.large, val)
        if len(self.large) > len(self.small) + 1:
            val = heapq.heappop(self.large)

            return -1*self.small[0]
        elif len(self.large) > len(self.small):
            return self.large[0]
        else:
            return (-1*self.small[0] + self.large[0]) / 2

        # If the sizes of the heaps are equal, the median is the average of the maximum element in the small heap and the minimum element in the large heap.
        # Otherwise, the median is the maximum element in the small heap if its size is greater, or the minimum element in the large heap if its size is greater.
