# Subtree of Another Tree

'''
Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false

'''
The isSameTree function is taken directly from that problem - Same Tree.
We want to figure out if any of the subtrees of root are the same tree as subroot.
